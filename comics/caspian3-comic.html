        <strong><em>Issue #03</em></strong><br /><br />

        <strong>COMING SOON!</strong><br /><br />
        The year is 2086.  Caspian Porter works for the SMCI Corporation delivering supplies to colonies throughout the solar system.  
        On a night celebrating his first delivery, Caspian makes two fatal mistakes.  One, he drunkenly gambled away supplies for his next 
        delivery. Two, he slept with his boss's wife...big mistake.
        <br /><br />
        On the run with his service robot, CRB (Curbie), aboard the spaceship, Assurance, Caspian and Curbie take damage 
        to the ship and inadvertently fly into a suspecting wormhole.  A strange new world awaits...
        <br /><br />
        In this exciting new issue, Caspian and Curbie discover the Merciless Pirates of Mars as they dismantle his ship for 
        salvage.  Caspian must fight to save what is his while trying to navigate the politics of Mars.  Meanwhile Piper and Ratchet 
        begin to catch up with Caspian!
