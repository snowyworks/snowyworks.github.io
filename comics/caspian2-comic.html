        The year is 2086.  Caspian Porter works for the SMCI Corporation delivering supplies to colonies throughout the solar system.  
        On a night celebrating his first delivery, Caspian makes two fatal mistakes.  One, he drunkenly gambled away supplies for his next 
        delivery. Two, he slept with his boss's wife...big mistake.
        <br /><br />
        On the run with his service robot, CRB (Curbie), aboard the spaceship, Assurance, Caspian and Curbie take damage to the ship and 
        inadvertently fly into a suspecting wormhole.  A strange new world awaits...
        <br /><br />
        In this exciting new chapter,  Caspian and Curbie discover more about their strange circumstances and find themselves on a 
        new world isolated by time where they must perform an act to win the people's trust!  In this new tale, we are introduced to new characters, 
        dinosaurs, and more!
