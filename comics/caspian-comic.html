        <strong><em>Issue #01</em></strong><br /><br />

        <strong>COMING SOON!</strong><br /><br />
        Caspian Porter is on the run! Hot on his tail are the SMCI Corporation's corporate cronies, ready to commandeer the ship,
        Assurance, a vessel that Caspian was given to perform an important task; shipping much needed supplies to the outer colonies.
        He failed, and now it's time to pay back the corporation with his life!
        <br /><br />
        Follow Caspian, along with his Service Robot named, C.R.B. (Curbie), on this wild new adventure as he finds himself in heaps and
        bounds more trouble along the way. Caspian will face death, time, and prehistoric dinosaurs in this first issue of an ongoing series!
