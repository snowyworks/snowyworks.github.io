          Terry works for the monster community. He's their cleanup guy, covering up their misdeeds in order to keep monsters a secret. Terry only operates 
          by two rules; listen to the Lycan king's orders and don't kill any monsters! Terry has trouble keeping his own inner demon contained,  while the 
          Council of Creatures, an all-governing group of monsters, dominates control over the hidden world. A battle is brewing among those tired of the council's 
          rule, who will survive?
