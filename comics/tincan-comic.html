        Twig and his two friends are just trying to make it their tough neighborhood.  Being the smallest kids around, 
        they do menial jobs for the local gang leaders.  Tonight, they are tasked with sneaking into a warehouse to find a weapon 
        that is supposed to change the balance of power in the neighborhood.  But after searching every room, all they find is a suit of 
        ancient armor.  Everything goes south when the police arrive, and the warehouse is surrounded...
        <br /><br />
        Twig soon finds that every time he uses the suit for good, a piece of it will fall off. Will he use this power to help people 
        and take pride in his neighborhood? As the threats escalate, his powers are reducing.  Eventually, he may have to face these 
        threats using only his wits...
