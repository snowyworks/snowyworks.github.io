        The year is 2086.  Caspian Porter works for the SMCI Corporation delivering supplies to colonies throughout the solar system.  
        On a night celebrating his first delivery, Caspian makes two fatal mistakes.  One, he drunkenly gambled away supplies for his next 
        delivery. Two, he slept with his boss's wife...big mistake.
        <br /><br />
        On the run with his service robot, CRB (Curbie), aboard the spaceship, Assurance, Caspian and Curbie take damage 
        to the ship and inadvertently fly into a suspecting wormhole.  A strange new world awaits...
        <br /><br />
        Everything comes full circle.  Caspian's fragile ego causes a rift between Rooster Valley and Whydah City to grow even larger.  
        Truces were broken and there is a battle looming.  A once peaceful valley is now doomed and even more surprises await.  Will Caspian 
        redeem himself or peril in the coming battle?
