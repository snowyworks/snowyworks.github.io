        Humanity's future rests in the hands of the students aboard the Starship Scholar, a cutting-edge vessel tasked with the mission to colonize Planet Ma. As they undergo intense training, they quickly realize that the pressure is higher than they anticipated.
<br /><br />
"I see before me, gathered greatness, poured in from every known corner of the world we left behind"
<br /><br />
Dr. Richard, a brilliant scientist with an erratic mind, is the one preparing them for their mission. His genius is unquestionable, but his methods are unorthodox, and his behaviour borders on madness. To the students, he's a teacher, but as his control over them tightens, they start to wonder if he's training them for something darker than colonization.
<br /><br />
"Today is the greatest day of your lives, the day where years of hard work have led you"
<br /><br />
Timothy and Brock try to control the chaos, but the longer they stay under Dr. Richard's tutelage, the more they realise that their survival may not depend only on the dangers of space. If they don't prepare properly, they may not make it to Planet Ma at all.
<br /><br />
"But the week that follows will be the worst days of your life"
